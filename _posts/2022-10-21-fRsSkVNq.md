John Mumby made his way to UT Southwestern Medical Center on foot Wednesday, carrying a large backpack and a large Gulf War Veterans flag.



&#8220;This walk has given me renewed purpose,&#8221; Mumby said. &#8220;We need to help our veterans in a way that the system was meant to help them.&#8221;
